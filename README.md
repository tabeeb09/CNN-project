**CNN Character Recognition MAchine learning Classifier **

Handcrafted algorithms used extensively with no direct usage of any neural network libraries to handle the network architecture. Currentyl not hardware optimised, and I am compute limited. 
As a result the model is not trained very well. Size and number of kernels can be adjusted, and uss the mnist database to detect handwritten characters, and classifies them from 0 to 9.
